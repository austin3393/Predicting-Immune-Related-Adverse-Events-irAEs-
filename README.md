# üß¨ Predicting Immune-Related Adverse Events (irAEs) in ICI Therapy  

## üìå Overview  
This project develops a machine learning framework to predict **immune-related adverse events (irAEs)** in melanoma patients treated with **immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)**.  
The work was conducted in collaboration with the **Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC)** as part of a graduate capstone project in Health Informatics & Data Science.  

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4) have revolutionized oncology care but carry high risk of irAEs ‚Äî unpredictable, potentially severe inflammatory reactions that may lead to hospitalization, permanent organ dysfunction, or early discontinuation of therapy. Current clinical guidelines emphasize **reactive management** of irAEs, but proactive **risk stratification** tools are lacking.  

This project explores whether **EHR-derived clinical and demographic data** can support **pre-treatment prediction of irAEs**, offering potential to guide monitoring, decision-making, and personalized care.

## üéØ Goals  
- Build and evaluate ML models to predict occurrence of irAEs.  
- Explore predictive power of **clinical, demographic, and comorbidity features**.  
- Provide exploratory data visualizations to uncover patterns in patient cohorts.  
- Establish a baseline modeling pipeline for future integration with genomics, labs, and unstructured notes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methods  
### Data  
- **Source:** Melanoma cohort from LCCC I/O Registry  
- **Features:**  
  - Demographics (age, sex, race)  
  - Clinical comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index, autoimmune history)  
  - Cancer/treatment variables (ICI regimen, cancer type, line of therapy)  
  - Outcomes: Occurrence of irAE (binary classification)  

### Approach  
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Feature selection & harmonization  
   - Handling missingness (dropping high-missing variables, removing incomplete records)  
   - Low-variance feature pruning  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**  
   - Cohort breakdown by demographics, comorbidities, and ICI regimens  
   - irAE prevalence visualization across subgroups  
3. **Modeling:**  
   - Baseline classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
   - AUROC evaluation of predictive features  
   - Comparison of model performance vs. univariate predictors

## üìä Key Findings  
- **irAEs were common** across the cohort, with variability by treatment regimen.  
- Certain comorbidities and demographics showed **signal in feature importance analysis**, though predictive power was modest.  
- Baseline models achieved **AUROC ~0.65**, establishing proof-of-concept for structured EHR-based prediction.  
- Missingness and cohort size remain major barriers, underscoring the need for **multi-institutional datasets** and **integration of labs/genomics**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies  
- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Data Handling:** REDCap export, feature engineering, cohort preprocessing  
- **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn

## üöÄ Future Directions  
- Incorporate **time-series labs** (e.g., blood counts, liver enzymes).  
- Extract **adverse event mentions** from **unstructured notes** via NLP.  
- Expand dataset with **multi-site harmonization** to improve model generalizability.  
- Explore **survival analysis & competing risk models** for time-to-event irAEs.
